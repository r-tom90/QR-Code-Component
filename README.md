## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Starting to apply the knowledge of the first HTML and CSS based project and becoming better at it. Need to understand a lot more overtime when to use display as flex compared to blocks, inline and inline-blocks along with box-sizing.
